Desktop User Stats Collector

## Description

Desktop industrial systems running on workstations in Windows, Linux, and MacOS have a long and slow learning curve for users to master the functionalities of such systems. However, it is difficult to assess how much each user knows and what their deficiencies are that require training.

Addressing this problem is the goal of this software. It allows all keyboard, mouse, and screen usage actions to be monitored for the purpose of extracting data for user proficiency analysis and usability of the desktop system being used.

## Results

You may notice that each left mouse button click is indicated in green, and the right mouse button click in blue. Also, all typed text is monitored.

At the top left of the screen, all actions are reported. This gives the user feedback that system usage is being monitored during that period.

In this example, we monitor how a user utilizes the zoom and attribute table details tools, as well as project saving, in the QGIS system installed on Windows 11.
